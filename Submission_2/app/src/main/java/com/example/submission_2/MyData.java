He is also characterized by a Brooklyn accent, his portrayal as a trickster, and his catch phrase \"Eh...What's up, doc?\". Due to Bugs' popularity during the golden age of American animation, he became not only an American cultural icon and the official mascot of Warner Bros.",
                                     "Daffy starred in 130 shorts in the golden age, making him the third-most frequent character in the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons, behind Bugs Bunny's 167 appearances and Porky Pig's 153 appearances. Virtually every Warner Bros. cartoon director, most notably Bob Clampett, Robert McKimson, and Chuck Jones, put his own spin on the Daffy Duck character.",

He speaks in an unusual way (rhotacism), replacing his R's and L's with W's, so \"Watch the road, Rabbit,\" becomes \"Watch da woad, wabbit!\" Elmer's signature catchphrase is, \"Be vewy vewy quiet, I'm hunting wabbits\"",

                                    "Road Runner always has a plan to get Wile E. Coyote off of his back. He also stars in his and Wile E's own shorts. He always gets the upper hand due to his fast speed, Wile E. Coyote's bad luck and the dysfunctional Acme products that Wile E. always orders.",
                                    "He is portrayed as \"The Fastest Mouse in all Mexico\" with his major traits being the ability to run extremely fast, being quick-witted and heroic while speaking with an exaggerated Mexican accent",
                                    "His name is taken from Yosemite National Park. He is an adversary of Bugs Bunny. He is commonly depicted as an extremely aggressive, gunslinging outlaw or cowboy with a hair-trigger temper and an intense hatred of rabbits, Bugs in particular"};
